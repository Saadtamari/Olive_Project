# Olive_Project
We all know how important plants and trees are in our lives and the amount of benefit we derive from them.
However, what we may not know is that 70% of trees around the world are affected by diseases, and only a few of them survive these diseases due to neglect of the trees and the misdiagnosis or late diagnosis of the disease.

In this project, I created a CNN model to detect whether a tree is infected with a disease or not by examining its leaves. 
I specifically chose to focus on the olive tree because it is one of the most important trees in my country (Jordan) and plays a crucial role in the agricultural economy of Jordan.

Initially, I collected data from Kaggle and started exploring it to find out that it was imbalanced data. 
I began dealing with it along with several other issues until I built the model using the Inception V3 model designed by Google, with some modifications to achieve an accuracy that exceeded 93%.

Enjoy!
